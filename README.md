# VTE_Report_Classification
**Automated classification of venous thromboembolism (VTE) from radiology reports using active learning and deep learning**

This repository contains the full codebase, documentation, and sample data configuration used in the study titled:
**"Detection and classification of venous thromboembolism through image test reports analysis using active learning and deep learning"** 


## Overview
This study investigates whether deep learning and machine learning combined with active learning strategies can accurately classify VTE (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) findings from free-text radiology reports. The goal is to reduce manual labeling workload and enhance model performance under limited data conditions.


## Models
- ML: SVM, Random Forest, GBM
- Word Embedding: TF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec
- Active Learning: Random, Uncertainty, Similarity-based
- DL: LSTM, Multi-Kernel 1D-CNN (GloVe), BERT, BioBERT, BioLinkBERT
